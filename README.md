## Description
These scripts implement a modified version of the facename task outlined by Sperling (2001) and 
Fleisher (2009).  The task consists of alternating novel and known blocks each separated by a
20 second fixation block.  Each block consists of 6 trials in which the stimulus is presented for
5 seconds followed by a 0.8 second fixation.  During the Novel blocks, participants are asked
to indicate whether the face 'fits' the name in order to maintain concentration on the task 
(ref needed).  During the Known blocks, the participants are asked to select between two names
indicating the correct name.

## Awknowledgements
These scripts are written on top of the [PyschoPy](http://psychopy.org/index.html) software 
package developed and maintined by [Jon Pierce](https://github.com/peircej).  Note that it is
released under the GNU General Public License (version 3).  If you publish work using these
scripts, don't forget to cite him (see the references at the end of this document).

The stimuli for these scripts were obtained from the 
[Chicago Face Database](http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/bernd.wittenbrink/cfd/index.html).
Again, if you publish work as a result of these scripts, don't forget to cite them (see the
references at the end of this document).
