-- Face Stimuli --
    These have been sourced from The Chicago Face database.
    (http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/bernd.wittenbrink/cfd/index.html)
    The faces used are from the caucasian dataset.  Faces were removed if they
    had jewlery, hairbands, glasses, etc..
    This left 90 female and 93 male faces.

-- Name Stimuli -- 
    Names have been selected from a list of the most popular baby names in South
    Australia from 1944-2013 (https://data.sa.gov.au/data/dataset/popular-baby-names)
    Removing duplicates, the __  most popular names for each gender for each year
    were used for randomly selecting the stimuli for names.
    This left __ female and __ male stimuli.

-- Randomized Run Generation --
    Lists of faces and names for each gender are loaded and shuffled for randomization. 
    A subset of them are removed for generation of the runs, and the resulting lists are
    zipped together to form random facename pairs.  The last pair from each
    gender list are used as the Repeated Faces.  For each novel block 0..n,
    indices (4*n)..(4*(n+1)) of each gender are alocated to that block.
    The blocks are shuffled.  This preserves gender balence, but not necessarily
    order within each block. For repeated blocks, the two faces are simply
    alternated, randomly selecting the gender to start.
